## About The Project

This is the final project from CS 412 Algorithms: Design and Analysis offered at Habib University in Spring 2022.

The goal of this project is to perform a empirical and theoretical analysis of the FFT and the naive DFT, accompanied by the application of FFT in signal processing and applying our implementation in this context.
